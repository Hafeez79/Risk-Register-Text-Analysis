# Risk-Register-Text-Analysis
Text analysis of a risk register

Risk registers often contain hundreds or even thousands of risks. This code generates a text based analysis of a risk register allowing analysts and risk managers to have a quick high level view of the key risks/themes in the entire register. As an illustration, I have included a dummy risk register based on excerpts from World Economic Forums's Global Risk Report 2018.
