101,Finance,Asset Bubbles,"If there were to be a sharp market
correction, the impact on the real
economy would arguably be greatest
in countries most heavily exposed to
sectors and markets in which bubbles
have formed—for example, a country
economically reliant on exports of
a commodity that plunges in value.
The impact of confidence and wealth
effects means that real-economy
impacts would also be felt strongly in
countries—notably the United States
and the United Kingdom—in which
the ownership of financial assets is
most widespread.
It is not just stocks and bonds that
have seen their prices rise. The
International Monetary Fund (IMF)’s
index of global house prices is close
to its pre-crisis peak again (see
Figure 2.2), and signs of stretched
valuations are evident in numerous
cities including Hong Kong, London,
Stockholm, and Toronto. Inflation in
all these traditional asset classes has
been dwarfed by more speculative
assets such as the cryptocurrency
Bitcoin, which increased in value by
around 1200% in 2017.
A further source of potential market
risk at present is that innovations
in financial assets and asset
management have yet to be tested in
crisis conditions. One example is the
rapidly expanding class of exchangetraded
funds (ETFs), which have
grown in value by 500% since 2008
and now account for US$4 trillion
of assets and around 25% of all US
stock market trading.4
 Some analysts
suggest that ETFs would cushion the
blow of a major market correction,
while others reckon they would
exacerbate it."
115,Finance,Indebtedness,"Indebtedness has risen differently in
advanced and emerging economies.
Advanced economies built up huge
debts before the crisis erupted, but
their overall level of debt has remained
relatively constant in the subsequent
decade: as a proportion of GDP,
modest deleveraging by households
and financial institutions has been
offset by increases in government
debt resulting from stimulus spending.
Meanwhile, signs of strain are evident
in parts of the corporate debt market.
According to S&P Global, 162
corporate defaults worldwide occurred
in 2016, the most since 2009 and
up from 113 in 2015.7
 The debt-toequity
ratio of the median S&P 1500
company (excluding financials) has
almost doubled since 2010 and is now
well above its pre-crisis level.
In emerging markets, by contrast,
aggregate debt levels were relatively
low and stable prior to the crisis but
have increased sharply since. This is
especially true in China, where debt
issuance has surged to help deliver
the high levels of growth the country’s
plans require. The rapid expansion of
debt in the Chinese economy is now
one of the world’s clearest flashpoints
for potential economic turmoil:
according to some analysts, China’s
current credit trajectory is “dangerous
with increasing risks of a disruptive
adjustment.”8
China’s banking sector has ballooned
to hold assets valued at US$33
trillion, or 3.1 times the country’s
annual output. Arguably, these
figures understate the full extent
of the country’s potential fragilities,
because they do not capture the
rapid growth of the more lightly
regulated shadow banking sector.9"
199,Finance,Financial Contagion,"The regulatory separation of the
financial sector in China from that
of the rest of the world reduces
the risk of systemically significant
financial spillovers, but as early as
2015 the governors of the European
Central Bank were cautioning that
“financial developments in China
could have a larger than expected
adverse impact.”10 Given how deeply
embedded China now is in the world
economy, if the country’s authorities
were to step in decisively to secure
the stability of the financial system,
the resulting slowdown in domestic
growth could represent a damaging
blow to global demand.
China can deploy vast resources
to protect its economy, but most
emerging economies are much more
directly exposed to any worsening of
global conditions. If the major central
banks’ interest rates were to move
significantly higher, lower-income
emerging market economies would
take a direct hit from the combination
of higher rates and worse exchange
rates, increasing the cost of borrowing
US dollars or other hard foreign
currency. Already there are signs that
debt-servicing costs for many of these
countries are rising gradually from
the record lows of a few years ago.
These problems are most pronounced
in countries with high levels of
foreign-currency debt, particularly oilexporting
countries where sustained
low oil prices have hit companies’
revenues and governments’ fiscal
positions. In October 2017, for
example, the governor of the Central
Bank of Kenya cautioned that
government debt in a number of
African countries has reached levels at
which an external shock “could push
us over”.11 Countries facing significant
strain include Angola, Gabon, Ghana,
Mozambique and Zambia."
218,Finance,Financial Systems Collapse,"There are reasons to be cautious,
despite this progress. Measures of
banks’ capitalization continue to rest
on risk-weighting methodologies
that mask a lot of uncertainty about
underlying risks. Calls are becoming
louder for radical reform of the
fundamental principles of banking, but there appears to be no political
will to introduce major reforms.
In fact, deregulation may now be
more likely: for example, pressure is
already mounting for a loosening of
the Volcker Rule. The issue of banks
being “too big to fail” has not gone
away, however: the assets held by the
largest 30 banks have grown from less
than US$30 trillion in 2006 to almost
US$43 trillion, and concentration is
continuing to increase. Meanwhile
strains have spread to emerging
markets: banks that were relatively
unscathed at the height of the crisis
have since had to contend with
the resulting deterioration of global
financial conditions and the sharp
downward turn of many
commodity prices."
222,Economy,Economic Policy Failure,"However, this scenario places a
lot of faith in the effectiveness of
unconventional monetary policies
such as asset purchases, particularly
when deployed as the primary line
of defence rather than alongside a
sharp interest-rate stimulus. Facing
a recession—let alone a crisis—with
very limited scope to cut interest rates
would be unprecedented.
The Fed has responded to past US
recessions by cutting its benchmark
policy rate by an average of 5.5
percentage points. That benchmark
rate currently stands at just 1.25%,
and market expectations are that it
will plateau at around 3%. In other
words, even if the Fed were to cut
rates to zero in response to a new
recession, there would still be at least
a 2.5 percentage point shortfall relative
to the usual scale of response.
Assuming they wanted to deliver a
similar level of stimulus, the European
Central Bank, the Bank of Japan and
the Bank of England would all face
even greater shortfalls given that their
interest rates are currently even lower
than the Fed’s.
Central banks were crucial to restoring
economic confidence among
households, businesses and markets
after the crisis. Repeating that feat
could be a struggle without interest
rates at their disposal. And without
a floor placed under confidence,
the risk of the next downturn being
much deeper and longer than might
otherwise be the case would increase.
"
266,Technology,Technological Disruption,"Although technological advances have
provided many benefits in emerging
economies, the associated risks are
arguably most pronounced in these
countries too. The World Bank,
among others, has cautioned that
current patterns of innovation threaten
the viability of long-established
paths to development.22 Historically
economies have developed by moving
workers from agricultural jobs into
export-oriented manufacturing jobs
that require similarly low skill levels
but deliver much higher productivity.
This “escalator to higher income
levels” breaks down when the
manufacturing sector becomes
sufficiently automated to require
workers who are more highly skilled.23
In these circumstances, developingcountry
productivity can stagnate or
decline if workers move back from
manufacturing into agriculture, or
from agriculture into low-end service
sectors where productivity can be
even lower.24 Latin America is the
clearest example of a region where
“premature deindustrialization” has
held back countries’ productivity
growth.25 The associated risks are not
purely economic—recent research
suggests that weak industrialization
can hamper the development of liberal
democratic institutions by affecting
the political divisions that become
dominant in a country."
295,Governance,Protectionism,"Political commitment to globalization
has weakened in the wake of the global
financial crisis and even minor disputes
could trigger an unravelling. Against a
backdrop of deepening protectionist
sentiment, trade disputes could spread
rapidly by triggering adverse impacts
and retaliatory moves along global
value chains. The same pressures
fomenting trade disputes would also
undermine the already-weakened
institutions designed to resolve them,
potentially leading to multilateral rules
being openly breached.
A breakdown of the global trade
system would roil supply chains and
reduce overall economic activity.
Adverse impacts such as lower output
and employment would be unevenly
distributed within and between
countries, creating new inequalities and
frustrations. If this in turn fuelled more
aggressive mercantilism, the risk would
increase of proliferating trade-related
disputes triggering deeper geopolitical
tensions and policies of gunboat
diplomacy on trade.
Whatever the settled position on global
trade is to be, more deliberation and
consensus-building would bolster its
legitimacy. A period of de-globalization
may be seen by many as a welcome
corrective, but rejecting current
frameworks in favour of binary
nationalistic approaches would cause
significant disruption. Securing durable
and worldwide support for globalization
would be made easier by an increased
domestic policy focus on cushioning
the impact on individuals and regions
affected by transitions in economic
activity."
297,Economy,Crop Failure,"In a world of growing
environmental strains our
increasingly complex food
system is becoming more
vulnerable to sudden supply
shocks. The interaction of
disruptors such as extreme
weather, political instability
or crop diseases could
result in a simultaneous
blow to output in key
food-producing regions,
triggering global shortages
and price spikes. The risk of
a systemic breakdown
could be further elevated by
wider fragilities, including
reduced crop diversity,
competition for water from
other sectors and
geopolitical tensions.
Widespread fear—let alone
death on a large scale—
could lead to devastating
spillover effects. Social
fractures would intensify in
affected and at-risk
countries. Political and
economic crises would be
likely. So too would a surge
in smuggling, both of food
and people. Against such a
volatile backdrop, crossborder
tensions could
worsen sharply, hampering
existing humanitarian
response networks,
frustrating efforts to develop
regional and global
mitigation strategies and
increasing the possibility of
interstate conflict.
Even on optimistic climatechange
trajectories foodsupply
risks will remain
elevated. Steps are needed
to improve sustainability and
resilience throughout the
food system. Among the
changes that could help are
increasing crop diversity,
establishing stress tests of
“choke points” and other
national and regional
vulnerabilities, reducing
waste along supply chains,
reaffirming humanitarian
principles and commitments
and establishing early
warning indicators."
298,Technology,Artificial Intelligence Weeds,"What if the adverse impact of
artificial intelligence (AI)
involves not a superintelligence
that takes control
from humans but “AI
weeds”—low-level algorithms
that slowly choke off the
internet? Algorithms are
already proliferating. As they
increase in sophistication—as
we become more reliant on
code that writes code, for
example—explosive growth
becomes more likely. A
divergence could open
between the code we have
created and our capacity to
track and control it.
The tragedy of the commons
means we often let chronic
problems with dispersed
responsibilities fester. Think
of plastic in the ocean. A
trend towards reduced
internet efficiency would
undermine service delivery in
countless
businesses. It could
hobble the Internet
of Things. It would
frustrate users. If the
problem became
significant enough, it
could prompt some
governments to wall
off parts of the
internet. If malicious
actors found ways
to proliferate or
weaponize the AI
weeds, they could
do extensive
damage.
As the global
demands placed on
the internet increase
in scale and
sophistication,
digital hygiene is
likely to become a
more pressing
concern for endusers.
The
development of
overarching norms,
regulations and
governance
structures for AI will
be crucial: without a
robust and
enforceable
regulatory
framework, there is
a risk that humans
will in effect be
crowded out from
the internet by the
proliferation of AI."
318,Governance,Threat to Democracy,"Democracy is already showing signs of
strain in the face of economic, cultural
and technological disruption. Much
deeper damage is possible: social and
political orders can break down. If an
evenly divided country sees polarized
positions harden into a winner-takes-all
contest, the risk increases of political
debate giving way to forms of
secession or physical confrontation.
In these circumstances, a tipping point
could be reached. A spiral of violence
could begin, particularly if public
authorities lost control and then
intervened on one side with
disproportionate force. In some
countries—with widespread ready
access to weapons or a history of
political violence—armed civil conflict
could erupt. In others, the state might
A new wave of populism threatens the social order in
one or more mature liberal democracies
Democracy Buckles
impose its will by force, risking longreverberating
consequences: a state of
emergency, the curtailment of civil
liberties, even the cancellation of
elections to protect public order.
The more that can be done to boost
the resilience and responsiveness of
democratic institutions, the less likely
they will be to buckle under pressure.
This might require processes of political
and constitutional experimentation. It
could even mean incorporating ideas
from post-conflict politics into everyday
democracy. We also need to better
understand the democratic fissures
currently being caused by the
economy, by social media and by
changing patterns of national identity."
380,Economy,Fisheries Depletion,"A third of all fish consumed in the
world are already caught illegally. AI
and drone technologies are
increasingly commonplace. Add to
these facts the automation of illegal
fishing, and the impact on fish stocks
could be devastating—particularly in
international waters where oversight is
weaker. Countless other areas exist
where the same logic might unfold:
huge short-term incentives might lead
to the use of emerging technologies in
ways that trigger irreversible long-term
damage.
A rapid collapse of fish stocks could
engender cascading failures across
marine ecosystems. Communities reliant
on fishing for their incomes might struggle
to survive, leading to fiscal pressures
and/or displacement. A sufficiently large
surge in the supply of illegal fish might
distort global food markets, leading to
disruption in the agriculture and foodproduction
sectors. If illegal drone fishing
crossed national maritime boundaries
and was perceived to be statesanctioned,
retaliatory measures might
lead to diplomatic or military tensions.
Targeted schemes such as genetic
markers to track fish throughout the
supply chain might limit demand for
illegally caught fish. So might better
vessel observation. But key to progress
in this and similar areas of hybrid
technological disruption will be new
global governance norms and
institutions, particularly those designed
to protect the global commons and
prevent the destructive deployment of
emerging technologies. "
420,Economy,Cascading Economic and Financial Crises,"Against a backdrop of domestic and
international political strife—and with
economic policy-makers already
operating in uncharted territory—the
eruption of another global financial
crisis could overwhelm political and
policy responses. A systemic collapse
of the sort that was averted in 2007–
2008 could push countries, regions or
even the whole world over the edge
and into a period of chaos.
If financial systems go down,
contemporary economies and
societies cannot function. Money
would stop circulating. Wages would
not be paid. Supply chains would break
down. Scarcity would begin to become
pervasive, and this would threaten to
upend the political and social order.
Policy-makers would pull every
available lever to restore stability. But
what if the prospect of another 
financial-sector bailout further enflamed
societies rather than calming them? Or
what if the financial system’s collapse
stemmed from a hostile cyberattack,
raising fears that more attacks and
disruption lie ahead?
More can be done to enhance the
resilience of the financial system.
Stress-testing methodologies could be
strengthened by assigning greater
weight to tail events and unexpected
consequences. Greater consideration
could be given to the growing number
of voices calling for radical change of
the way the banking system works. But
societies might also want to prepare
more actively for worst-case scenarios."
426,Technology,Bioengineering and Cognition Enhancement,"Drugs for human enhancement are in
their early stages, but scientific
advances may well be exponential. In a
world of entrenched inequality, many
people might choose to disregard
potential health risks in order to
maintain or elevate their status.
Ingestion would be impossible to
monitor, and even if bans are put in
place black market channels would
inevitably emerge.
If the price tag is significant and the
benefits are strong, the result would be
ever-deeper and more entrenched
inequality. This could trigger social
instability and conflict between the
haves and have-nots. Divergent
regulatory responses could lead to
productivity disparities across countries
and the emergence of “enhancement
tourism” flows. If unforeseen
consequences—such as serious brain
deterioration—emerged in the future it
could create a massive public health
crisis.
Stronger measures to combat existing
inequality might reduce consumption
incentives, but that seems doubtful.
Early and appropriate regulation of
enhancement technologies may be
more successful than an outright ban.
For example, new workplace equality
legislation might require employers to
confirm that all staff are compliant with
enhancement rules. If these
technologies were ever proven to be an
unalloyed good—analogous to
vaccinations—then the regulatory
objective might shift to ensuring
universal access. "
454,Technology,Cyber wars,"Offensive cyber capabilities are
developing more rapidly than our ability
to deal with hostile incidents. This
creates a fog of uncertainty in which
potential miscalculations could trigger a
spiral of retaliatory responses. Imagine
that a country’s critical infrastructure
systems are compromised by a
cyberattack, leading to disruption of
essential services and loss of life—the
pressure to retaliate would build rapidly,
potentially setting off an escalatory
chain reaction.
Questions of speed and attribution
heighten the risk of unpredictable
consequences. If an attack is
developing more quickly than the
targeted state’s efforts to identify the
attacker, retaliation might be
misdirected, drawing new actors into a
widening conflict. This would add to the
potential for further confusion and 
escalation, including the resort to
conventional military force or the
unintended widening of conflict if an
active cyberweapon inadvertently
spreads through cross-border
networks into non-target countries.
In conventional warfare, agreed norms
and protocols provide predictability and
slow the emergence of crises. If
governments accelerated current
efforts to establish similar ground rules
for cyberwarfare, it would help to
prevent conflict erupting by mistake.
Familiar concepts such as
transparency, proportionality and
non-proliferation could be re-codified
for cyber purposes. And perhaps
classes of cyberweapons could be
collectively prohibited, in the same way
biological and chemical weapons have
been."
472,Society,Contested Borders,"At a time of global geopolitical
uncertainty, the twin forces of national
identity and self-determination are
growing in disruptive capacity. Already
this is leading to violence and
constitutional instability, at times
spurred on by foreign powers.
Examples include states expelling
ethnic or religious minorities, national
minorities attempting to secede and
nation-states extricating themselves
from international constraints on their
sovereignty.
A deepening of disputes over cultural
and political borders would trigger
widening clashes, potentially causing
regional domino effects as states and
sub-state actors mobilize in defence of
or opposition to the status quo. This
instability would create new trigger
points for interstate conflict, particularly
in regions where disputes over selfdetermination
are long-standing and
are likely either to be resolved violently
rather than consensually or to draw in
regional hegemons and/or global
powers.
Stronger promotion and protection of
equal cultural and political rights within
states would help defuse tensions
about national identity. So would the
fostering of stronger economic and
other links between states sharing
contested borders. Drawing on
successful examples of constitutional
innovation—such as multilevel and
cross-community forms of
governance—might help guide the
administration of internally divided
polities."
543,Technology,Fragmentation of the Internet,"A proliferation of damaging crossborder
cyberattacks might be the most
likely trigger for a government-led
breakup of the internet into national or
regional “walled gardens”, but there are
many other potential drivers that could
lead governments in this direction:
economic protectionism, regulatory
divergence, censorship and repression,
the fraying of national political
discourse and the loss of government
power relative to global online
companies.
Fragmentation of the internet could
involve, among other things,
interruption of technical internet
functions or barriers to the flow of
content and transactions. Some might
welcome a move towards a less
hyper-globalized online world, but 
many would not: resistance would be
likely, as would the rapid growth of
illegal workarounds. The pace of
technological development would slow
and its trajectory would change.
Human rights abuses would likely
increase as advances in international
monitoring were rolled back.
Advances in cybersecurity governance
and technology ought to mitigate the
risk of worsening cyber disruption and
theft that would trigger the imposition
of firewalls. Ongoing dialogue between
governments and technology
companies would help to ensure that
internet-based technologies develop in
a politically sustainable context of
shared values and agreed
responsibilities."
597,Environment,Extreme Weather Events,"Extreme weather events in 2017
included unusually frequent Atlantic
hurricanes, with three high-impact
storms—Harvey, Irma and Maria—
making landfall in rapid succession.
According to the Accumulated
Cyclone Energy (ACE) index, which
is used to measure the intensity and
duration of Atlantic storms, September
2017 was the most intense month on
record. It was also the most expensive
hurricane season ever.13 These
extreme incidents continue a trend
towards increasingly costly weather
events over recent decades (see
the US data in Figure 1.2), although
rising costs reflect factors such as the
location and concentration of assets
as well as changing weather patterns.
Extreme rainfall can be particularly
damaging—of the 10 natural disasters
that caused the most deaths in the
first half of 2017, eight involved floods
or landslides.14 Storms and other
weather-related hazards are also a
leading cause of displacement, with
the latest data showing that 76%
of the 31.1 million people displaced
during 2016 were forced from their
homes as a result of weather-related
events.
Rising temperatures and more
frequent heatwaves will disrupt
agricultural systems that are
already strained. The prevalence of
monoculture production heightens
vulnerability to catastrophic
breakdowns in the food system—
more than 75% of the world’s food
comes from just 12 plants and five
animal species, according to the Food
and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations, and it is estimated that
there is now a one-in-twenty chance
per decade that heat, drought, and
flood events will cause a simultaneous
failure of maize production in the
world’s two main growers, China and
the United States.17 This would cause
widespread famine and hardship.
Fears of “ecological Armageddon”
are being raised by a collapse in
populations of insects that are
critical to food systems: researchers
in Germany found falls in such
populations of more than 75% over 27
years."
623,Environment,Loss of Biodiversity,"More broadly, biodiversity loss is
now occurring at mass-extinction
rates.19 The populations of vertebrate
species declined by an estimated 58%
between 1970 and 2012.20 Globally,
the primary driver of biodiversity
loss is the human destruction of
habitats including forests—which are
home to approximately 80% of the
world’s land-based animals, plants,
and insects21—for farming, mining,
infrastructure development and oil
and gas production. A record 29.7
million hectares of tree cover was lost
in 2016—an area about the size of
New Zealand. This loss was about
50 percent higher than 2015. As 
much as 80% of the deforestation
in Amazon countries is accounted
for by cattle ranching, suggesting
that pressures on environmental and
agricultural systems will intensify
as the global population increases,
pushing up demand for meat.
"
657,Environment,Pollution,"Pollution moved further to the fore
as a problem in 2017: indoor and
outdoor air pollution are together
responsible for more than one
tenth of all deaths globally each
year, according to the World Health
Organization (WHO). More than
90% of the world’s population live in
areas with levels of air pollution that
exceed WHO guidelines.23 Deaths
are overwhelmingly concentrated in
low- and middle-income countries,
where health problems caused
by pollution exacerbate strains on
already stretched health systems
and public finances. In November
2017, a public health emergency was
declared in Delhi when air pollution
reached more than 11 times the WHO
guideline levels.24 Urban air pollution
is likely to worsen, as migration and
demographic trends drive the creation
of more megacities.
Soil and water pollution cause about
half again as many deaths, according
to findings published in October
2017 by the Lancet Commission 
on Pollution and Health.25 The
Commission estimates the overall
annual cost of pollution to the global
economy at US$4.6 trillion, equivalent
to around 6.2% of output. Many of the
associated risks to health are still not
well understood. Research suggests,
for example, that the huge volume of
plastic waste in the world’s water—
approximately 8 million more tons
every year26—is finding its way into
humans. People eating seafood could
be ingesting up to 11,000 pieces
of micro-plastic every year.27 Microplastic
fibres are found in 83% of the
world’s tap water.28 One concern is
that these micro-fibres could bind
with compounds containing toxic
pesticides or metals, providing these
toxins with a route into the body."
